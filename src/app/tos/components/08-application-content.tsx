        Okay, here's the thing about the content we provide on our app (we call this ‚ÄúApplication Content‚Äù): we use data
        from other people and artificial intelligence technologies to make it happen. That's how we keep things fresh
        and personalized. But here's the kicker: our content is just for information and personal use. We're not trying
        to push you to do anything based on it. Bottom line is, don't rely too much on our content. We won't be able to
        tell you about every single change that happens. If you decide to use our content to make decisions, that's on
        you. You gotta be responsible for your own actions üòõ
