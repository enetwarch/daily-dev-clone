# Clone of Daily.dev

This is a practice project that aims to clone [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/). This clone copies the layout and design of the website, but it does not fully copy it in a pixel perfect manner. A non-vanilla tech stack was used in the project to help me get used to each of them.

### Tech Stack

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Makes JavaScript tolerable by providing IntelliSense through types, making the codebase more predictable and maintainable.
* [React](https://react.dev/): A component-based JavaScript library that combines JS and HTML into one file through JSX.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A CSS framework that helps eliminate one of the hardest things in programming: naming things. It comes with many utility classes for inlining your styles.
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A full-stack web development framework made by Vercel. It has useful features like server-side rendering and SEO optimization.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Hosting platform that easily integrates Next.js.
